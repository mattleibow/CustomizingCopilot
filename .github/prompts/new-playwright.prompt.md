Read this docs for more info on getting started: 
* https://playwright.dev/dotnet/docs/test-runners
* https://playwright.dev/dotnet/docs/intro

Requirements:
* Always use the latest stable packages.
* Use the `Microsoft.Playwright` for testing.
* Use **MS Edge** for the browser.
* Don't use headless mode.
* Assume the correct browser is installed and skip the installation.
* The app will launch on `https://localhost:7022/`.
* Read all the razor pages and ensure you use the correct IDs, names and other identifying features for the elements you will look for in the tests.
