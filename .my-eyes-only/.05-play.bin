1. Load the home page 
2. Confirm that "Laptop" is in the list of products. Give the element id of the item

5. Confirm that "Laptop" is not in the list. Check all items to make sure.


After every UI action, explicitly parse and list all visible table rows or relevant elements from
the latest page snapshot or accessibility tree. Do not rely on previous state or assumptionsâ€”always
re-extract and enumerate the actual content after each change. Only make assertions about presence
or absence of items based on this direct, up-to-date inspection. If you cannot confirm from the
latest data, say so and request a new snapshot.
