Can you go through every product in this json file and then to an image search to find the best image. 

Guide:
* Use the product name as the search query. 
* Update the product by adding a "imageUrl" property in the json. 
* Do all 100 items.
* Process in chunks of 10.

The process should be:
1. get the product name of the first 10
2. do the image search for each of the 10
3. update the 10 product entry in the file
4. continue

Always update the file as you do it as there are too many to do in a single go.
